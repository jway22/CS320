# CS320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance


1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  The best way to ensure that my software is functional and secure is through testing. By making sure that my tests cover as much of my code as possible I can be sure that I've left as little room for errors as possible. Pairing this with software security such as input validation, buffer management, and using things like least privelege (among many other things) can really help keep my software secure and functional in the way that is intended.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  I think it's important to keep the user in mind and be communicative with users and clients as the software is being developed. Get as much information as possible before development starts and check in frequently to make sure that development is happening in a way that is expected. Frequent check-ins can help make sure that the software is being developed the way shareholders or clients want as sometimes what a client describes isn't what they actually mean. By communicating often, these issues can be caught and corrected early.

3. How do I approach designing software?

  I tend to take a more Agile approach to software development. I get a broad idea of what I wan't to make, either on my own or for class, and then just start coding, generating ideas and cleaning up and improving my code as I go. Prior to this class, I did a lot of manual testing and pretty frequently, making sure that little bits of code that I had added worked properly before moving on to the next part that I intended to develop. Going forward from this class, I hope to add more automated testing to spare myself some time and effort while also covering more of my code in an efficient way.
